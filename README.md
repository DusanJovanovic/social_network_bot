# Django social network and bot

## Getting Started

Fire up two shells, one for django project one for bots.py script and follow the instructions from readme.

### Prerequisites

Install python virtual environment if not present.

```
pip install virtualenv
```

number_of_users, max_posts_per_user, max_likes_per_user are in the bots/config.json file.
In config.json file in my django project there are my tokens for clearbit and hunter.io. You should change them and put your own because I may exceed the limit of permitted requests.
